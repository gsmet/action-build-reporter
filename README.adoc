= action-build-reporter

A GitHub Action producing a build report of a workflow run and publishing it in the job summary.

This is the counterpart of the reports published by the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-github-bot[Quarkus GitHub Bot] as pull request comments and is mostly useful for forks.

This action is based on:

- https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-github-action[Quarkus GitHub Action]
- https://github.com/quarkusio/build-reporter[Build reporter]

== Setting up the action

The action needs to have access to the currently generated artifacts.
Artifacts are accessible to the GitHub REST API only after the workflow run is completed.
Thus we use the GitHub `download-artifact` action which uses internal APIs to download the artifacts while the workflow run is still running.

The action has to be run in a separate job that depends on all the other build jobs.

For instance:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  ... various other jobs ...

  build-report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build report
    needs: [build,jvm-green,jvm-initial,native-green,native-red]
    if: always()
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: build-reports-artifacts
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: 17
      - name: Produce report and add it as job summary
        uses: quarkusio/action-build-reporter@main
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          build-reports-artifacts-path: build-reports-artifacts
          forks-only: true
----

You can omit `forks-only` if you want to publish the job summary even for the upstream repository.
